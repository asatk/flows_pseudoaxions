    training samples/data are stored with the suffix "_data.npy" instead
    of the previously-used "_samples.npy" 
    training labels/conditional data are stored with the suffix "_cond.npy"
    instead of the previously-used "_labels.npy"
    whitening constants for data are stored with the suffix "_data_wtn.npy"
    instead of the previously-used "_normdata.npy" 
    whitening constants for conditional data are stored with the suffix

analysis_utils.py
> analyze
    included all epoch losses (not exluding the first anymore) because the
    behavior of `plot_losses` has been updated to plot as semilog
> plot_losses
    losses vs epoch plotted as semilog time series. negative losses are
    plotted as their abs. val. but in red. the first turnover point, where
    losses go positive to negative, is plotted as a gray dashed line
